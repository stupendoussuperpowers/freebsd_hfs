For list of files that have been 'fixed' so far, check MAKEFILE SRCS= \

---

The following general API changes have been accomodated:

VOP_LOCK    -   No thread arg 
VOP_UNLOCK  -   No thread arg, no flags
MALLOC (a, b, c, d, e) -> a = (b) MALLOC(c, d, e)
FREE -> free
VOP_FSYNC

stuct buf's b_ops changes to buf->b_bufobj->buf_ops

__private_extern__ and static functions need annotations fixed.

function definitions for vfs_ops functions, (e.g. hfs_mount(struct mount*) )

Inconsistent use of 'const' in various hfs_encoding functions.

hfs_attrlist.c seems to be missing several headers, sys/attr.h is not a valid header anymore. 
Lots of pointer arithmetic not allowed by clang. (Added MOVE_PTR, MOVE_PTR_SET to accomodate for these).
Look at the mask checks which are currently commented out.

<set/get>attr'list' functions seem to not be directly supported.

TODO:

Some restructuring of code may be required (moving certain fucntions to hfs_vfsutils.c)
Add tests
    - xnu/tests
    - Custom tests to comply with hfsfuse behaviour
