The following general API changes have been accomodated:

VOP_LOCK    -   No thread arg 
VOP_UNLOCK  -   No thread arg, no flags
MALLOC (a, b, c, d, e) -> a = (b) MALLOC(c, d, e)
FREE -> free
VOP_FSYNC

stuct buf's b_ops changes to buf->b_bufobj->buf_ops

__private_extern__ and static functions need annotations fixed.

function definitions for vfs_ops functions, (e.g. hfs_mount(struct mount*) )

Inconsistent use of 'const' in various hfs_encoding functions.

hfs_attrlist.c seems to be missing several headers, sys/attr.h is not a valid header anymore. 
Lots of pointer arithmetic not allowed by clang. (Added MOVE_PTR, MOVE_PTR_SET to accomodate for these).
Look at the mask checks which are currently commented out.

<set/get>attr'list' functions seem to not be directly supported.

*quota functions need more work, they seem to be relying on interfaces that have changed completely. Currently they are ifdef guarded by 'DARWIN_QUOTA'. 

Inconsistent use of integer pointers likely due to the original code expecting 32 bit pointers. Changed to u_intptr_t whereever possible. 

Non-existent 'console_user' on FreeBSD.

Using GEOM APIs. g_vfs_open(...)

Current hang/crash is mostly because of EIO errors when reading vcb->catalogRefNum from the dmg. For 100m dmg, it crashes, for 512m dmg, it hangs.

TODO:

Some restructuring of code may be required (moving certain fucntions to hfs_vfsutils.c)
Add tests
    - xnu/tests
    - Custom tests to comply with hfsfuse behaviour
