List of changes
----------------------

The following general API changes have been accomodated:

VOP_LOCK    -   No thread arg 
VOP_UNLOCK  -   No thread arg, no flags
MALLOC (a, b, c, d, e) -> a = (b) MALLOC(c, d, e)
FREE -> free
VOP_FSYNC

__private_extern__ and static functions need annotations fixed.

function definitions for vfs_ops functions, (e.g. hfs_mount(struct mount*) )

Shims headers added to sys/ and vfs/

Lots of pointer arithmetic not allowed by clang. (Added MOVE_PTR, MOVE_PTR_SET to accomodate for these).

*quota functions need more work, they seem to be relying on interfaces that have changed completely. Currently they are ifdef guarded by 'DARWIN_QUOTA'. 

Inconsistent use of integer pointers likely due to the original code expecting 32 bit pointers. Changed to u_intptr_t whereever possible. 

Non-existent 'console_user' on FreeBSD.

Using GEOM APIs. g_vfs_open(...), g_vfs_close(...). Replace use of IOCTL calls with struct geom_consumer.

Use KERNBUILDDIR to avoid incompatible KBIs when building kernel with different flags than the kernel module.

Use of modern APIs such as insmntqueue()

Implement buf_obj_ops
